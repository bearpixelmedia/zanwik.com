# Deployment & Production Guidelines

## Build Process
1. Build React app: `cd client && npm run build`
2. Ensure all linting errors are fixed
3. Test the build locally before deployment
4. Verify static assets are properly served

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Separate development and production configs
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use proper .env file management

## Server Setup
- Port 3000 for backend API
- Static file serving for landing page and React app
- Proper CORS configuration for production
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## Database Setup
- MongoDB Atlas for production database
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Supabase for authentication
- Proper backup and recovery procedures

## Security Considerations
- HTTPS in production
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security updates

## Monitoring & Logging
- Implement proper logging levels
- Monitor application performance
- Set up error tracking
- Health check endpoints

## Deployment Platforms
- Railway deployment configuration available
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Docker support for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
